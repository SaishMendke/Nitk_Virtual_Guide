# Nitk_Virtual_Guide

I have created a Java Application for the task "Nitk Virtual Guide"

# WORKING 

* The App is developed for Students, Clubs and College Authorities with the help of MySql database which has tables to store Login credentials, Event Information, News and Mess Menu.

* Students can see the schedule of Events of various Clubs, News, that particular Day's Mess Menu and a 2-D Map of NITK. Only upcoming and ongoing Events are shown to the Students with the help of a Mysql query.

* Clubs can login through their credentials and add/delete their respective Club's Events which will be updated on the Mysql database so that the change is seen by everyone.

* Authorities can login and update the Mess Menu and post News. All these changes are reflected onto the main database.

I have attached the video which shows the working of the App.
